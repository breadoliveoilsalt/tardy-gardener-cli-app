# TardyGardener

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tardy_gardener'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tardy_gardener

## Usage

This cli app scrapes data from the Cornell University gardening website (http://www.gardening.cornell.edu/homegardening/scene0391.html) in an attempt to provide information about certain vegetables in a concise manner.  The goal for future versions is to build out the cli app so that it tells you when certain vegetables will mature if you plant them now (or at a later date). 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to rubygems.org (https://rubygems.org).
